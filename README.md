Scraping the American Statistical Association's 2020 Internship Posting. 

## Last updated: January 6th, 2019

Data source: https://stattrak.amstat.org/2019/12/01/2020-internship-listings/

The scraping code is provided in the .Rmd file. While the exported data is not in tidy format, the formatting should make it fairly resilient to new postings. 

The scraped data can be found at [ASA_Postings.csv](https://github.com/TheDavidChen/ASAInternships/blob/master/ASA_Postings.csv).
